      <h3>Why choose me for your chicken's sunglasses needs?</h3>
      <p>
      My experience and my backing studies done by the USDA using my chicken sunglasses.
      My sunglasses boosted the chickens overall confidence which encouages higher egg production.
      The reduction of glare during the chickens time spent in the sun was proven to
      ease chickens stress, make them happier and tastier then ever before.
